# [Mx](https://github.com/nobe4/mx)

Mx (to pronounce 'Mix') is a combined interface for all your favorite audio/video sources.

It adds the native controls into the websites or your choice.

# Why?

You are working with Spotify in the background, in one of many tabs on your web
browser, and you want to pause the song, just press the `Pause` button on your
keyboard. No need to look for the tab, it's simple!

Wait, the Spotify App already does this? Well, add Youtube and Souncloud,
remove the ads... And you have Mx.

# How?

No secret, no special sauce, all is simple. It's an
[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) App, launching the different websites and
binding keys to javascript clicks. Easy peasy.

# What?

Currently in the box:

- Spotify
- Youtube
- SoundCloud
- Bandcamp

The ads removal is not perfect, but it's not the point of this application anyway.
